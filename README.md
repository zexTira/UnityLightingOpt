# UnityLightingOpt
A unity lighting optimization project in VR environment

Unity Version:2021.3.18.f1c1

The project requires a vr headset to handle everthing, and there are two methods implemented in the project, in which you can use the buttons to control if each module should be enabled/disabled
The effect of optimization can be checked from the FPS param, which is also visulized on the screen.
